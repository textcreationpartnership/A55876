            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEhold the Spirit of the <hi>First Reformers</hi> in the <hi>First Liturgy,</hi> and compare it with the <hi>later Liturgies</hi> of <hi>Succeeding Reformers,</hi> and consider how much <hi>our Reformers</hi> have varied from <hi>Themselves</hi> at <hi>Home!</hi> Next, reflect upon <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Censure of the same; that there were in it <hi>Tolerabiles quaedam Ineptiae,</hi> some Passable Fooleries; and compare it with the Sense that <hi>King,</hi> and both the <hi>Parliament</hi> that <hi>Enforced,</hi> and that which <hi>Repealed</hi> it had of it, as well as Archbishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fox;</hi> and see how much <hi>our First Reformers</hi> at <hi>Home</hi> have varied from <hi>Those Abroad!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>First Reformers</hi> indeed acted by no <hi>Spirit</hi> but the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> what shall we say of that Spirit by which <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> acted, when he treated the Dictates of the Holy Spirit with so little Reverence, as to Style them, <hi>Tolerable Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?</hi> And if in the Opinion of K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Compilers of the <hi>First Liturgy</hi> might lay claim to, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum est Spiritui Sancto &amp; Nobis; It seem'd good to the Holy Ghost and to Us:</hi> How came the <hi>Parliament</hi> that <hi>Repealed</hi> it, to be <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and to assume to themselves a Power to controul and alter his <hi>Decrees,</hi> in Repealing what themselves confess'd, was according to <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and the <hi>Usages</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church?</hi> To be short, if the <hi>Spirit</hi> which guided the Compilers ef the <hi>First Liturgy</hi> was own'd no less than <hi>Infallible;</hi> how came it to give way to that <hi>Fallible Spirit,</hi> which has appear'd in all the Changes that have past from the <hi>Succeeding Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> down to the <hi>Present?</hi> For since the Church of <hi>England</hi> has pass'd all along under the Name and Notion of a <hi>Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> being left at this Æ²ncertainty, men have wrote in the dark about <hi>Popery</hi> and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing either what <hi>Popery</hi> was, or what the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that being called <hi>Popery</hi> in the <hi>later Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which was not in the <hi>First;</hi> and that made the Church of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Modern Reformers,</hi> which knew no such Name in the <hi>Beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear these Points, is the Design of the following Papers, that is, of the Extract of K. <hi>Edwards</hi> first <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and of the <hi>Testimonials</hi> annexed to it, in the nature of a <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> shall I say, or rather of <hi>Hallowing</hi> it, for they want but a little of raising it to as <hi>Sacred a</hi> Character as that of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> it self, and of maintaining that <hi>Liturgy</hi> to be as much <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as the <hi>Bishops</hi> that were the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the <hi>Office,</hi> is Styled the <hi>Mass,</hi> and how well the Name agrees to it, may be gathered from the following Instances. The <hi>Priest</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to stand in the <hi>Middle</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> with his <hi>Back</hi> towards the <hi>People;</hi> the <hi>Vestments</hi> prescribed the <hi>Priest</hi> are an <hi>Albe</hi> and <hi>Tunicles</hi> with a <hi>Cope:</hi> Besides which, there is mention made of the <hi>Paten</hi> and the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
<pb facs="tcp:56117:3"/> Utensils</hi> and <hi>Ornaments,</hi> now much better known to those that assist at <hi>Mass,</hi> than those that go to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer.</hi> There is at the time of the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> an express <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> even as the <hi>Mass</hi> which it Copies in this particular, is declared to be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the <hi>Living</hi> and the <hi>Dead.</hi> Nor do the Compilers content themselves with this, but back this with an <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Angels.</hi> And that the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> may not be in the <hi>Popish Garb</hi> alone, the very <hi>Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elements</hi> appear in the <hi>Popish Shapes,</hi> of a <hi>Wafer-Cake</hi> and a <hi>Mingled Chalice.</hi> And what is more yet, they are <hi>Consecrated</hi> by <hi>Crossing</hi> them, much after the manner of the Beginning of the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> at the words, <hi>Haec Dona, haec Munera,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Communicants</hi> are ordered to receive the same at the <hi>Priest's Hand</hi> in their <hi>Mouths,</hi> with such a <hi>Form</hi> of Words, as are but the <hi>English</hi> of those, with which all are <hi>Communicated</hi> at <hi>Mass</hi> at this day; without the Additional Supply of, <hi>Take this in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> &amp;c. to give it the contrary Turn of a bare <hi>Commemoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>other Offices,</hi> are not as fair Copies of the <hi>Breviary,</hi> as this of the <hi>Communion</hi> is of the <hi>Mass,</hi> may better appear from consulting the <hi>Extract</hi> it self where the <hi>Reader</hi> in the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> will meet with <hi>Prayers</hi> appointed for the Shifting of the <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Font,</hi> which are a kind of <hi>Exorcisms</hi> for <hi>Dispossessing</hi> of the <hi>Water,</hi> in lieu of the <hi>Antient Exorcisms</hi> for <hi>Dipossessing</hi> of the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> Nor do they stay here, but add the <hi>Anointing</hi> of the Person Baptiz'd, the <hi>Chrysome,</hi> and the <hi>Crossing</hi> of him more fully in the <hi>Popish</hi> Mode, on the <hi>Forehead</hi> and the <hi>Breast</hi> together.</p>
            <p>They also add the <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and in <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:</hi> In which <hi>Office,</hi> as also in that of <hi>Visitation</hi> of the <hi>Sick;</hi> the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Story of <hi>Tobias</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Raguel</hi> is brought into a <hi>Prayer,</hi> though the <hi>Benedicite</hi> and the <hi>Apocryphal Lessons</hi> struggled hard to
<pb facs="tcp:56117:4"/> keep their Places in the <hi>last Liturgy,</hi> after the <hi>late Kings Restoration.</hi> In the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Visitation</hi> of the <hi>Sick,</hi> they go as high as <hi>Extreme Unction,</hi> notwithstanding the shy Insinuation of <hi>later Reformers,</hi> that this was exercised in the Nature of a <hi>Miraculous Gift,</hi> and so determin'd with the <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Miracles.</hi> Nay, what is more surprizing, they have rais'd it to the Dignity of a <hi>Sacrament</hi> in their <hi>Prayer</hi> upon <hi>Administring</hi> the <hi>Oyles,</hi> as far as an <hi>Outward Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sign,</hi> and an <hi>Inward Invisible Grace,</hi> will carry it for a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Nor are we to forget the grave Comfort and Allowance, which the <hi>Priest</hi> is to give such of the <hi>Sick,</hi> as <hi>would,</hi> but <hi>cannot Communicate;</hi> that upon exercising an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> upon the Merits of <hi>CHRISTS Cross</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> such have all the Right to and Advantages of a <hi>Spiritual Communion.</hi> A Term which is yet no Stranger to such * Churches as open their Doors to all such as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> in <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Desire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Sess. <hi>22.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> though they stand not so fair for <hi>Communicating actually.</hi> But is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred here for the sake of such as shut all <hi>Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants</hi> at once out of their <hi>Churches,</hi> leaving no Place in <hi>Sacrament-time</hi> for any, but the <hi>Actual Communicants:</hi> Although they provide them no better Entertainment, than that of a bare <hi>Spiritual Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> To instance in no more; in the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Burial</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> besides direct <hi>Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> such was their <hi>Extraordinary Charity,</hi> as they furnished out over and above, an <hi>Office</hi> of set purpose, of <hi>Communion</hi> for the <hi>Dead.</hi> Now if we speak the Language of that <hi>Liturgy,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Statute</hi> that enforc'd it, of K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Injunctions Injunct. 21. Communions</hi> are no more than <hi>Masses:</hi> And if so, we have gain'd this point; that <hi>Masses</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> as Scandalous as they sound in the Ears of <hi>late Reformers,</hi> were not only more Innocent, but highly approv'd of and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by the <hi>First Reformers.</hi> Nor did they oblige others, to more than they practised themselves, if <hi>Stow</hi> says true, who tells us, <hi>That on</hi> June <hi>19. (1547.) a</hi> Dirge <hi>was Sung
<pb facs="tcp:56117:4"/> in every</hi> Parish Church <hi>in</hi> London,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Henry</hi> II</note>
               <hi>for the</hi> French <hi>King late Deceased</hi> (viz. March <hi>22. last past) Also the Church of S.</hi> Paul <hi>being hanged with</hi> Black, <hi>and a Sumptuous</hi> Herse <hi>set up in the</hi> Choire, <hi>a</hi> Dirge <hi>was there Sung, and on the next Morrow, the Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of</hi> Eight Bishops, <hi>all in Rich</hi> Miters, <hi>and other their</hi> Pontificlas, <hi>did Sing a</hi> Mass <hi>of</hi> Requiem. Thus <hi>Stow</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Edward VI.</hi>

            <p>Æ²pon the whole matter it appears, that such Doctrines and Practices as now pass for <hi>Popish,</hi> were in the Beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> esteem'd no other than the genuine Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>England, by Law Established.</hi> As for Instance, that of <hi>Communion in One Kind,</hi> at least in some Cases of Necessity; for so much appears from the Statute of <hi>1 Edw. VI.</hi> Requiring that <hi>Sacraments</hi> be commonly <hi>Administred</hi> in Both Kinds, if Necessity <hi>does not require</hi> otherwise: By which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they took it for no <hi>Precept</hi> to Communicate in <hi>Both Kinds,</hi> for no <hi>Necessity</hi> can lye to break a flat <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi> Nor does it less appear, from the <hi>Rubrick</hi> in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which says, notwithstanding the <hi>Division</hi> of the <hi>Wafer-Cake,</hi> men are not to take it, that <hi>CHRIST</hi> is <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>whole,</hi> and <hi>less</hi> in the <hi>less.</hi> For if <hi>CHRIST</hi> be <hi>whole</hi> in every <hi>Particle</hi> of the <hi>Host,</hi> certainly he is <hi>whole</hi> in the <hi>whole Host;</hi> and by consequence, if he be <hi>whole</hi> in <hi>each kind, Communion</hi> in <hi>One Kind</hi> cannot be called truly <hi>Half</hi> a <hi>Sacrament:</hi> To this we may add, that of <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> practised by <hi>Cranmer, Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> (as <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> was allowed by <hi>Bilney</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi> in their distinguishing between <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> and <hi>Intercession,</hi> and granting that the <hi>later</hi> might be <hi>Prayed</hi> to, as such <hi>Mediators.

            <p>Since the <hi>First Reformers,</hi> and their <hi>Heirs</hi> have thus unfortunately divided in their Accounts of <hi>Popery,</hi> what shall we say has occasion'd the Difference? Is <hi>Popery</hi> changed, or the <hi>Reformation?</hi> Assuredly, there are no <hi>New Poperies,</hi> for if there were, that bold Demand so often made, to assign the <hi>Age</hi> in which any of their <hi>Errours</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, had long since received an Answer. It remains then, that there Are, and Have been <hi>New Reformations:</hi> I know it uses to be said for these <hi>New Reformations</hi> upon the <hi>Old,</hi> That the Case of the <hi>First Reformers</hi> resembl'd that of Men proceeding out of a dark <hi>Cave,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Light</hi> by which they acted,<note place="margin">(Holy Table Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So it was, that the <hi>First Reformers</hi> had the ill luck to venture on the work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> without consulting the
<pb facs="tcp:56117:5"/> Oracle of the <hi>Reformation:</hi> And <hi>Calvin</hi> taking pet that they advis'd with the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> rather than with <hi>Him;</hi> what could the Church of <hi>England</hi> do less, being thus unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily in the good Mans Displeasure, but to Court his Favour, fairly lay aside the <hi>Holy Ghost's Liturgy,</hi> to make way in good Manners for Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s. Till in the end, after so many <hi>New Liturgies,</hi> they came to have <hi>None</hi> at all. For it is very observable, that the more the Church of <hi>Eng.</hi> land has enlarg'd her <hi>Phylacteries</hi> and made broad her <hi>Fringes,</hi> the more she has betrayed her <hi>Nakedness,</hi> her <hi>Dissenters</hi> having still increased upon her, in proportion to her multiplying her <hi>Liturgies:</hi> For as by changing her <hi>Old Liturgies</hi> for <hi>New,</hi> she lost the Company of the <hi>Old Papists</hi> to Court the <hi>Old Non-conformists,</hi> so by changing these again for <hi>Newer,</hi> at length she lost, even the Company of the <hi>New Non-conformists.</hi> Nor is the Success to be wondred at; for if men once came to be so bold as to find fault with the <hi>First</hi> which was the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> much more would they venture to be bolder with the <hi>Later,</hi> which were own'd to be but the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> If the <hi>First Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> were in the <hi>Wrong,</hi> what Assurance have we, say the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> that the <hi>Later</hi> who boast not the same <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> are in the <hi>Right?</hi> Or if the <hi>First</hi> were so <hi>Blind,</hi> as to spy but <hi>some Errors</hi> of <hi>Popery;</hi> who knows whether their <hi>Heirs,</hi> who are but the <hi>Blind led by the Blind,</hi> have discover'd <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Errors</hi> of the <hi>Reformation?</hi> Since the same Fate attends all <hi>later Reformations</hi> upon the <hi>First,</hi> which uses to follow the Attempts of curing the <hi>Streams</hi> where the <hi>Spring</hi> is <hi>Impure,</hi> or of supporting a <hi>Building,</hi> whose <hi>Foundation</hi> is in the <hi>Sands.</hi> For the self same Reasons and Motives, which the <hi>First Reformers</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> make use of to colour <hi>Schism</hi> their from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> these <hi>Reformers</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of to colour their <hi>Schism</hi> from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> concluding in such Cases, that if the <hi>Primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> be not the <hi>Purest,</hi> that cannot fail to be so, which
<pb facs="tcp:56117:6"/> is the <hi>Latest.</hi> For if it appear'd an Error in the <hi>First Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> to use <hi>Prayers for the Dead,</hi> after disclaiming <hi>Purgatory</hi> which brought them in; what was it less in the <hi>Later</hi> to practise <hi>Bowing</hi> to the <hi>Altar,</hi> and enjoyn <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at the <hi>Communion,</hi> after renouncing <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which occasion'd <hi>Both.</hi> For which is the greater So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecism, to offer <hi>Prayers</hi> for those that <hi>need them not,</hi> or to give <hi>Divine Honour</hi> to what <hi>deserves it not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>First Reformers</hi> would have taken the <hi>Test,</hi> is perhaps as great a Question, as whether those that have <hi>taken</hi> the <hi>Test,</hi> would have received their <hi>Liturgy:</hi> For upon a just Comparison of the <hi>Primitive Liturgy</hi> with the <hi>Present,</hi> the Case will be found much the same with that of <hi>Apelles</hi> his two <hi>Pieces.</hi> For that great <hi>Master</hi> having exposed an <hi>Original</hi> of his to the publick View of the gazing Crowd, they were not more concerned to hit all the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Blots</hi> which he made, than he was to <hi>Reform</hi> them all in another <hi>Piece</hi> that he prepared accordingly; which by being <hi>Reformed</hi> so often, proved so monstrous a <hi>Libel</hi> on his Art, as the <hi>Reformers</hi> laughing at their <hi>own Picture,</hi> no less than the <hi>Artist</hi> himself; he was obliged in his own Defence to produce the <hi>Original,</hi> and the <hi>Reformation</hi> together, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Hanc ego feci, istam Populus, This</hi> is <hi>my Picture,</hi> and <hi>That</hi> is <hi>Yours.</hi> And were the <hi>First Reformers</hi> alive again that made the <hi>Old Liturgy,</hi> I perswade my self, they would make themselves as Merry with the <hi>New</hi> one, if they were not ready to dismiss them <hi>Both</hi> with the same pleasant Application.</p>

               <p>Hear the Testimony of Archbishop <hi>Bancroft;</hi> He speaking of this <hi>Liturgy,</hi> in a <hi>Sermon</hi> of his Preach'd at St. <hi>Paul's-Cross, Anno</hi> 1588. affirms of it, that it was Publish'd first <hi>with such Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that it was accounted the Work of God:</hi> Thus that Archbishop, and more he could not have said, had he been the <hi>Inspired</hi> Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> or any of the other <hi>inspired Bishops,</hi> that in the Style of K. <hi>Edwards Parliament,</hi> drew it up by the <hi>Aid</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>The practice of <hi>Mingling Wine and Water</hi> in the <hi>Chalice,</hi> had place in His <hi>Majesties Chappel Royal,</hi> all the time that Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> was Dean of the said <hi>Chappel.</hi> Nay, in that Testimony which they have so often triumphed in, and which was therefore publish'd first and attested with so much Solemnity, by the Names and Subscriptions upon Record, of the Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>London, Durham, Winchester,</hi> &amp;c. in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Days, I mean Abbot <hi>Aelfrikes Saxon Homily</hi> upon <hi>Easter,</hi> we are told thatâ€” <hi>Holy Books command that</hi> Water <hi>be mingled to the</hi> Wine <hi>which shall be for</hi> Housel (<hi>i. e. the</hi> Host) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the</hi> Water <hi>signifies the</hi> People, <hi>and the</hi> Wine CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> Blood. And therefore shall neither the <hi>One</hi> without the <hi>Other</hi> be offer'd at the <hi>Holy Mass</hi> (so as S. <hi>Cyprian Epist. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi> requires) that CHRIST may be with Us, and We with CHRIST, the Head with the Limbs; and the Limbs with the Head. â€” Thus Abbot <hi>Aelfrike</hi> for his Time, which was about 700 years since. Nay some of the <hi>Reformed Writers</hi> themselves, doubt not to apply that of <hi>Proverbs</hi> 9.2. <hi>Wisdom has mingled her Wine, she has also furnish'd her Table;</hi> to this purpose, esteeming it no other then a Prediction of our Blessed Lords Institution of the <hi>Blessed Sacrament:</hi> So in particular, <hi>Ashwel</hi> on the <hi>Communion,</hi> as many of the <hi>Antient Fathers</hi> had apply'd it before, So <hi>Rabbi Samuel Marochianus,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56117:16"/> who liv'd in the year 1070. and was a <hi>Converted Jew,</hi> and is extant in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom.</hi> 9. p. 421. <hi>What is this</hi> Table (says he, <hi>de Adventu Messiae</hi> c. 20.) <hi>the</hi> Wisdom <hi>of the most High has furnish'd, but the</hi> Altar? <hi>What is this</hi> Bread <hi>and</hi> mingled Wine, <hi>but the</hi> Sacrifice <hi>of</hi> Bread, Wine <hi>and</hi> Water, <hi>which is offered on the</hi> Altar? Thus he and so long before him S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Epistle to <hi>Caecilius;</hi> who calls it our <hi>Lords Tradition,</hi> and as such, requires it to be observed. <hi>Dominica Traditio servetur.</hi> Upon which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the late Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> in his Edition of that <hi>Father,</hi> being otherwise at a loss to Defend their <hi>Half-Cup,</hi> of <hi>Wine without Water,</hi> is driven in his <hi>Notes</hi> on that <hi>Epistle,</hi> to serve himself of one or two wretched Palliations; as first, he Notes the different practice of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> in the <hi>mingled Chalice,</hi> observing from <hi>Balsamon</hi> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> mingle <hi>Warm Water,</hi> as the <hi>Latines, Cold:</hi> But will any gather a concluding Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from hence, for <hi>Neither?</hi> In some late <hi>Councils</hi> it is left indifferent, to Administer <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> in <hi>Warm Water,</hi> or <hi>Cold;</hi> now will any take occasion from hence to Administer it in <hi>No Water.</hi> This Refuge failing him, his next Evasion is yet more frigid. He says, <hi>The</hi> Canon <hi>only requires</hi> Modicum Aquae; as if in his Logick, <hi>None at all,</hi> and so <hi>Little,</hi> as <hi>next to None,</hi> were all one. Let us try the force of his Argument in another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, That is, in his own Church-Custom of <hi>Baptizing</hi> by a slender <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> since the <hi>Non-user</hi> of <hi>Immersion.</hi> It may be said alike, that there is but <hi>Modicum Aquae.</hi> And then making the same Inference, that <hi>None,</hi> and what is so <hi>Little,</hi> as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56117:17"/>
                  <hi>next to None,</hi> comes all to one. And so by one and the same Argument, our Blessed Lords <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> may be evacuated both in the <hi>One,</hi> and in the <hi>Other Sacrament</hi> at once.</p>

               <p>Again, This <hi>Devotion</hi> we do gladly profess to owe to <hi>good Angels</hi> (he speaks here in the Name of his <hi>Church</hi>) that though we do not Pray unto them, yet we do Pray to God for the Favour of their <hi>Assistance</hi> and <hi>Protection;</hi> and Praise God for the <hi>Protection</hi> that we have from them.

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56117:18"/> contend; or whether (as it is no less Probable) this <hi>Angel</hi> were not any Created Power, but the great <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the same which <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> wrestled with before, for a <hi>Blessing</hi> upon <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> as S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> well conceive it, I will not here dispute. Sure I am, if it were an implicite Prayer, and the <hi>Angel</hi> mention'd a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (it seems he is not sure of the Contrary) yet the Intention was no other then to Terminate that <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> who Blesses us by his <hi>Angel</hi> (which is a kind of <hi>Popish Logick,</hi> in behalf of a <hi>Popish Practice.</hi>) He proceeds, â€” yet further, we come short of our <hi>Duty</hi> to these <hi>Blessed Spirits</hi> (says he) if we entertain not in our hearts an high and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conceit of their wonderful <hi>Majesty, Glory</hi> and <hi>Greatness,</hi> and an awful acknowledgement and reverential Awe of their <hi>Presence;</hi> an Holy Joy to do ought that might Cause them, to turn away their <hi>Faces</hi> in <hi>Dislike</hi> from us.

               </p>

B. of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and <hi>Blandford</hi> B. of <hi>Worcester,</hi> as the Margent acquaints us) '<hi>They both</hi> told her, there were <hi>Many Things</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which (it were <hi>very much</hi> to be <hi>Wished,</hi> they are their own Words) <hi>We</hi> had <hi>kept;</hi> as <hi>Confession,</hi> which was no doubt, <hi>Commanded by God:</hi> That <hi>Praying for the Dead,</hi> was one of the <hi>Antient Things</hi> in <hi>Christianity.</hi> Nor do they stay here, but add, That for their Parts, they <hi>did</hi> it <hi>Daily,</hi> though, they would <hi>not own it.</hi>
                  </q> From which frank Confession it appears, that those <hi>two Prelates</hi> were good Invisible <hi>Catholicks</hi> at the same time in their <hi>Closets,</hi> and good Visible <hi>Protestants,</hi> in their <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56117:25"/>
               <p>But what was the Concealed Practice of these <hi>Prelates</hi> in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, seems to have been the Open and Avowed Practice or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Others</hi> of the <hi>same Communion,</hi> who have not stuck to make as Solemn Mourn and Lamentation for these <hi>lost Devotions,</hi> as for their <hi>lost Friends.</hi> Such was the above-named Bishop <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> to whom we may add the Learned <hi>Herbert Thorndike,</hi> late Prebend of <hi>Westminster,</hi> who in his last <hi>Manuscript-Paper,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before his Death under his own Hand, was bold to Note and Bewail it as <hi>a Defect in the Reformation, that it wanted Prayers for the Dead:</hi> But what the <hi>Reformation wanted,</hi> he took Care to <hi>supply</hi> for his own <hi>Particular,</hi> by leaving this <hi>Epitaph</hi> behind him, when he was Buried in <hi>Westminster,</hi> of which Church he was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend. <hi>Hic jacet</hi> Herbertus Thorndike, <hi>quondam hujus Ecclesiae Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendarius. Qui Vivus, veram Rationem &amp; Modum Reformandae Ecclesiae, Precibus Studiis{que} prosequibatur. Tu Lector</hi> Requiem ei in CHRISTO, <hi>&amp; beatam Resurrectionem precare. Here lyes</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Thorndike, <hi>once Prebend of this Church: Who Living, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the true Way and Method of</hi> Reforming the Church <hi>by his Prayers and Studies. Thou Reader Pray for his</hi> Requiem <hi>in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and Happy Resurrection.</hi> So equal a <hi>Reconciler</hi> was he betwixt the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> that <hi>Erasmus</hi>-like, he hung between both; for if the <hi>Protestants</hi> had him <hi>Living,</hi> he gave himself <hi>Dead</hi> to the <hi>Catholicks:</hi> And as his <hi>Epitaph</hi> begins (like <hi>Himself</hi>) with <hi>Reforming of the Church;</hi> so it ends (like <hi>Himself</hi>) with <hi>Reforming of the Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More briefly and plainly yet Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> late Bishop of S <hi>Asaph,</hi> (who could not be frighted from this practice, though he died during the Heat of the late <hi>Plot) Ora, pro Anima Mea.</hi> And though both their <hi>Epitaphs</hi> met with the like Fate, to be <hi>Buried</hi> together with their <hi>Authors;</hi> yet may it seem a Work of some Piety to give them that <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which they so earnestly wished for <hi>Themselves.</hi>
